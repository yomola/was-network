          <div class="day-body">
            <p><strong>Scripture:</strong> 1 Samuel 25:1</p>
            <p>
              <strong>Context:</strong> Samuel's death marks a spiritual turning point for Israel. With national leadership shifting and tensions rising, 
              Abigail lives in a troubled time and in a troubled marriage. Yet she stands out as a woman of discernment and grace. 
              Her environment is difficult but her character is steadfast.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Application:</strong> Reflect on whether your environment challenges your character. Ask God for grace to shine even in hard seasons.

            <p><strong>Scripture:</strong> 1 Samuel 25:2–3</p>
            <p>
              <strong>Context:</strong> Scripture intentionally contrasts Abigail and Nabal, her wisdom against his harshness and folly. 
              Abigail's character is not shaped by her husband's attitude but by her relationship with God. Sometimes God places His 
              people in difficult homes or workplaces to reveal His light.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Application:</strong> Pray for strength to represent God faithfully, even when surrounded by difficult people.

            <p>
              <strong>Context:</strong> David greets Nabal with kindness, acknowledging the integrity of Nabal's shepherds, something 
              attributed to Abigail's diligent oversight. Abigail cultivated an atmosphere of excellence even under poor leadership. 
              Wisdom influences the culture around it.
            </p>
            <p>

              <strong>Context:</strong> David's men respectfully request provision, reminding Nabal of their past protection. 
              Nabal's refusal is not merely ungrateful, it is foolish and dishonourable. Abigail will soon face the consequences 
              of someone else's disrespect.
            </p>
            <p>

              prayer, and wisdom. Abigail becomes a stabilising force in chaos, showing that one godly person can influence an entire household.

            <p>

              <strong>Context:</strong> David interprets Nabal's insult as betrayal and prepares for revenge. In moments of rising tension, 
              true character emerges. David reacts but Abigail will respond with divine discernment.

              <strong>Context:</strong> Abigail's confidence flows from trusting God, not her circumstances. Trusting God allows us to 
              act in faith even when situations feel overwhelming. You can rely on God regardless of the circumstance.
